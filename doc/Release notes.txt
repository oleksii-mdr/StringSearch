Prerequisites
------------

Source code has been developed in Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 targeting .NET 4.5.
It is possible, however, to run this code on .NET 3.5 with only configuration changes.

Unit tests have been developed using NUnit 2.6.1 (library included) and executed from Jet Brains Resharper 7. 
It is possible to run unit and integration tests from NUnit runner. Please note, if you would like to 
run integration tests from Resharper, a shallow-copy of executed assembly must be disabled. Alternatively,
paths to testing data in a configuration file must be adjusted. 

Detailed task description and design decisions can be found in separate documents:

 /doc/Task1.Readme.txt
